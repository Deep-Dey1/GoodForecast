## 🆘 Getting Help

### If You Get Stuck:

1. **Check the Troubleshooting section** in BEGINNER_GUIDE.md
2. **Read error messages carefully** - they usually tell you what's wrong
3. **Check Docker logs**: `docker logs container-name`
4. **Restart services**: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.cicd.yml restart`
5. **Google the error** - with "Docker" or "Jenkins" in the search

### Common Issues Quick Links:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Docker won't start | BEGINNER_GUIDE.md → Troubleshooting → Docker Desktop |
| Port already in use | BEGINNER_GUIDE.md → Troubleshooting → Port conflicts |
| Jenkins container fails | BEGINNER_GUIDE.md → Troubleshooting → Jenkins |
| SonarQube out of memory | BEGINNER_GUIDE.md → Troubleshooting → SonarQube |
| Build fails | JENKINS_SETUP.md → Troubleshooting |

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Before You Start:
1. **Close unnecessary applications** - Free up RAM
2. **Have good internet** - Will download ~5GB
3. **Set aside 3-4 hours** - Don't rush
4. **Follow guides in order** - Each builds on previous

### During Setup:
1. **Read error messages** - They're helpful!
2. **Wait for services to start** - Give them 2-3 minutes
3. **Copy passwords/tokens** - You'll need them
4. **Test each step** - Verify before moving forward

### After Setup:
1. **Bookmark Jenkins and SonarQube** - You'll use them often
2. **Review SonarQube reports** - Learn about code quality
3. **Understand each pipeline stage** - Don't just run blindly
4. **Keep Docker running** - Jenkins needs it

---

## 📊 What Each Stage Does

```
Pipeline Stages:

1. Git Checkout        → Gets your code from GitHub
2. Install Deps        → Downloads npm packages
3. Code Quality        → Checks coding standards
4. Unit Testing        → Runs your tests
5. Build App           → Creates production build
6. SonarQube Analysis  → Analyzes code quality
7. Quality Gate        → Ensures quality standards
8. Docker Build        → Creates container images
9. Push Images         → Uploads to Docker Hub
10. Clean Up           → Removes temporary files
```
